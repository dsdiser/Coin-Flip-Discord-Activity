write websocket implementation
- goal is to synchronize state between clients and "host"
- Users should be able to join a room based on an id (set a static one for now)
- clients should be "trusted" aka they should be able to send global state and send it out to anyone
- Should write system to set state based on results of websocket messages
- The messages should be structured as JSON objects stringifies to be sent over the wire
- Should think about using atoms in jotai for this. Set a base incoming message atom. Each further atom can be set based on the incoming websocket message.
- There is only one layer of interface with the websocket. Set a message history atom, with smaller derived atoms as needed

Example usage: Host should be able to send a message saying that the coin is being flipped, along with the random seed.
- The seed should be its own jotai atom

Keep communications simple and keep code small and simplistic to make it easier to implement new features
